Description: GNOME UPnP/DLNA services
 Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video
 and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In technical
 terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through
 a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is
 achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA and on the fly
 conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.
 .
 This package contains the core of Rygel and following plugins:
   * media-export: Recursively exports folders and files specified in the
     user configuration. This plugin supports all types of URIs that
     gio/gvfs and GStreamer can handle.
   * external: A MediaServer plugin that exports media hierarchies
     provided by external applications.
   * mpris: Export of media players that implement MPRIS2 D-Bus interface,
     as MediaRenderer devices.
